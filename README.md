## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

This project visualizes IMU sensor data (roll, pitch, yaw) as a real-time 3D rotating cube. Originally built in Processing, this Python version includes advanced buffer management for zero-lag response and professional UI design.

### âœ¨ Key Features

- âš¡ **Real-time response** - Zero lag through smart serial buffer management
- ðŸŽ¯ **Accurate orientation mapping** - Corrected coordinate system transformations
- ðŸ“Š **Professional UI** - Clean matplotlib display with no text overlaps
- ðŸ”„ **Dual modes** - Serial IMU data + Demo mode for testing
- ðŸŽ® **Interactive controls** - Keyboard shortcuts for easy operation
- ðŸ“¡ **Robust communication** - Handles Arduino serial data at 115200 baud

## ðŸ›  Hardware Requirements

- Arduino Uno/Nano/ESP32
- MPU6050 IMU sensor (or compatible 6-DOF/9-DOF sensor)
- USB cable for serial communication

## ðŸ’» Software Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- matplotlib (3D plotting)
- arduino ide
- numpy (mathematical operations)
- pyserial (Arduino communication)

## Guide to use:
- upload the MPU_basic code to Arduino Uno (or any boards by doing appropiate modifications))
- run the realtime_imu.py
- Wait 7 seconds for CALIBRATION
- Have fun


# Real-Time IMU 3D Visualization-Arduino Processing version

ðŸŽ® The original Processing implementation of real-time IMU visualization that inspired the Python version. Features direct Arduino-to-Processing communication with 3D cube rotation based on MPU6050 sensor data.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

This is the original Processing sketch that visualizes IMU sensor orientation data as a real-time rotating 3D cube. The cube responds instantly to physical movement of the MPU6050 sensor, providing intuitive visualization of roll, pitch, and yaw rotations.

### âœ¨ Key Features

- ðŸŽ® **Processing-native 3D rendering** - Smooth, responsive visualization
- âš¡ **Real-time Arduino communication** - Direct serial data streaming
- ðŸŽ¯ **Accurate orientation mapping** - Roll, pitch, yaw visualization
- ðŸŽ¨ **Colorful 3D cube** - Different colored faces for easy orientation reference
- ðŸŽ® **Interactive controls** - Keyboard shortcuts for mode switching
- ðŸ“Š **Live data display** - Real-time angle values and connection status

## ðŸ›  Hardware Requirements

- **Arduino Uno/Nano/ESP32**
- **MPU6050 IMU Sensor** (6-DOF accelerometer + gyroscope)
- **Jumper wires** for I2C connection
- **USB cable** for Arduino-PC communication
